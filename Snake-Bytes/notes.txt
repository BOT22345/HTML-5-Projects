step-1 create basic setup 
step-2 add assets 
step-3 
    - create one main div(main-container) and three div inside (main-container) div named (scoreBox, maxScoreBox, board) with (scoreBox) having the current score = 0 and (maxScoreBox) having max score which will be stored in local storage of the user 
    - HTML part done here 

step-4 import font of your choice for score board and set universal padding and margin  to 0

step-5 create css for class main-container and board 
    main-container : background as image ,height and width, display will be flex,  justify-content will be center
    board: add background as linear graident, height and width and border, display as grid, template rows as grid-template-rows: repeat(18,1fr), same way for columns ** remeber first is number of so it will be 18 not 18fr 

step-6 divide the whole js into three sections variable, functions and main-logic-section using comments and create 4 sound variables and one variable for object having x property with value 0 and y property as value 0
    direction
    foodSound 
    gameOverSound
    moveSound
    musicSound

step-7 now we use the window.requestAnimationFrame(takesCallbackFunction)
    in function section we first create one then call it main by passing this
    function as callback function to requestAnimationFrame and we call that function
    in it again so that it is being called recurssively 
    function main(ctime){ function creation
    window.requestAnimationFrame(main); recurssively calling itself
    }   
    window.requestAnimationFrame(main); calling main function for first time
